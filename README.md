Sales Performance Analysis

Role: Junior Data Analyst
Technologies: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Google Colab, Power BI
Dataset: Retail Superstore Sales Data

Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales transaction data to understand sales performance across time, regions, customer segments, and product categories.
The analysis was performed using Python in Google Colab. The main goal was to clean and structure raw data, calculate key sales metrics, and prepare datasets suitable for business reporting and dashboard creation.

Business Objectives
Analyze sales trends over time on a monthly and yearly basis.
Identify top-performing regions, states, and cities.
Compare customer segments such as Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office.
Evaluate performance of product categories and sub-categories.
Calculate key metrics including Total Sales, Number of Orders, and Average Order Value.

Tools and Technologies
Python with Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
Google Colab for running and sharing the analysis.
Power BI for building dashboards and visualizations.

Data Processing Workflow
Data cleaning included removing duplicate records, converting date columns to datetime format, and filtering invalid sales values.
Feature engineering included creating time-based features such as year and month, and calculating shipping duration.
Aggregation and analysis included grouping sales data by time, region, category, and customer segment and calculating KPIs.

Key Metrics
Total Sales
Number of Orders
Average Order Value
Average Shipping Time
Sales by Month
Sales by Region
Sales by Customer Segment
Sales by Category and Sub-Category

Key Insights
Sales show clear seasonal patterns with noticeable peaks during specific months.
Certain regions consistently generate higher sales compared to others.
The Consumer segment contributes the largest share of total sales.
A relatively small number of product categories account for the majority of revenue.
